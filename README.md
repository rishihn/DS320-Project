# DS320-Project
Data Integration Project for DS 320
The main objec1ve of the term project is to demonstrate the feasibility of some of the learned data
integra6on techniques to enable searching for informa6on across mul6ple sources and/or improve the
predic6ve/sta6s6cal analysis of a challenging real-world problem.
Some example project ideas are:
• Use Python+SQL to integrate and query across mul6ple databases. Treat each database as a
source, and define a mediated schema. Demonstrate queries on the mediated schema that are
translated to a logical query plan and then executed to return query results.
• Write Python code to extract and integrate data from mul6ple heterogenous data sources and
then demonstrate the use of the data for downstream sta6s6cal and/or machine learning based
analyses.
• Write Python code to demonstrate fusing mul6ple classifiers, trained on different sources of data
or on different views of the same data source, for predic6ve analysis.
• Write Python code to demonstrate how to learn an aligned representa6on for mul6ple
modali6es such as text, image, or audio, and use the representa6on to perform downstream
tasks such as recogni6on/classifica6on.
Each team can include 3-6 members.
Schedule:
10/4: Team formed
10/24: Pitch your project. This will be a 5-minute presenta6on using 1-3 slides. The slides should include:
project 6tle, team members, background, objec6ve, methodology, and expecta6on.
12/10 and 12/13: Final project presenta6on, to be given in class by ALL team members
12/14: Final submission due, including slides used for presenta6on, report, and code (or link to code
repository)
Final submission
- A single zipped file including
o Final presenta6on slides.
o Report (a word file with the following sec6ons: Abstract, Background, Methods, Results,
Discussions, and Conclusions).
o Code or a word file including the link to your code if hosted in a source code repository.
